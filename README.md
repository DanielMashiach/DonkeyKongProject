Donkey Kong Game (C++)
The game allows the player to control Mario and rescue the princess while avoiding AI-controlled monsters and explosive barrels across multiple platforms and ladders.

The project supports several run modes:
• -save – records all player movements into a file
• -load – replays a previously recorded game
• -silent – runs the game in a non-visual verification mode

Includes object-oriented design, file I/O handling, AI behavior for enemies, collision detection, and dynamic game logic.
